# Permanent rclone QA Resources

This code generates sample data for testing the [SFTP
service](https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service) for
[Permanent.org](Permanent.org).  It creates test trees containing
files with various pathological names, which are meant to be uploaded
to Permanent via [rclone](https://rclone.org/) using the SFTP
protocol.
