# Permanent rclone QA Resources

This project is intended for testing the [SFTP service](https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service). This repository 
will have a bunch of helper tools in a separate repository, whose purpose is just to help us do manual QA, and then 
later that gets turned into automated tests in the SFTP service repository. Refer to our discussions
